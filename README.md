## Introduction

Robust statistics is a branch of statistics dealing with outliers, i.e., observations that substantially deviate from the norm. Here we present Julia implementation of the robust methods for generalized partial additive partial linear models that are discussed in [Lee (2019)](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/71526).
